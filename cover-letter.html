        Dear Hiring Manager,
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        I am writing to express my strong interest in joining the Solana team. As a self-taught full-stack developer with a unique background spanning military engineering, railway operations management, and Web3 gaming development, I bring a distinctive combination of technical excellence, leadership experience, and unwavering determination to deliver results under pressure.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        My journey into blockchain development exemplifies my capacity for rapid learning and autonomous execution. After founding DD Gaming in 2024, I taught myself Next.js and TypeScript from scratch to build Scrolly—a social gaming platform featuring 25+ games—which won the Solana Mobile Hackathon. I developed the entire platform independently, successfully deploying to iOS, Android, and Solana Mobile Stack. This achievement demonstrates not only my technical capabilities but also my ability to deliver production-ready applications without extensive hand-holding.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        My ten years as Lead Mechanical Engineer in the British Royal Navy's Commando Helicopter Force instilled in me the discipline, precision, and problem-solving skills that translate directly to complex software engineering challenges. I earned distinctions in my HNC Aeronautical Engineering whilst serving, and was awarded medals for my acts of service. Currently, as Shift Production Manager for London's railway operations, I manage critical infrastructure and high-stakes decision-making daily, further honing my ability to perform under pressure and lead teams in demanding environments.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        What drives me is an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a genuine passion for the Solana ecosystem. I have been actively building my reputation within the community for several years, most recently through our Developer Capital Markets (DCM) initiative—live-streaming the creation of complete Solana projects in 8-12 hour sessions to onboard founders who lack resources but possess drive. I am highly proactive, self-motivated, and committed to contributing meaningfully to Solana's continued growth and success.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        I am confident that my combination of rapid learning ability, technical versatility across multiple stacks (Rust, TypeScript, Unity, React, Solana SDK), and proven track record of independent delivery makes me an excellent fit for your team. I don't just write code—I solve problems, think creatively, and deliver results.
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with Solana's needs. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.
    </div>

    <div class="closing">
        Yours sincerely,
    </div>
